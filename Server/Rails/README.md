# Hyperstack and Rails

Hyperstack is most mature in the Rails ecosystem. There are however a number of ways of implementing Hyperstack with Rails:

+ Adding Hyperstack to an existing multi-page Rails application
+ Using Rails as a back-end for a Hyperstack single-page-application (SPA)

## Adding Hyperstack to an existing Rails application

Our recommended approach to adding Hyperstack to an existing Rails (multi-page) application is to go one step at a time:

+ Start by adding a few Hyperstack Components to existing ERB View templates - this will get your familiar with the Hyperstack build system and add stunning, interactive Components to your static HTML pages (without needing to learn JavaScript)
+ Next upgrade some of your Models so you can share data with the client
